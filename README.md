## Project Description

-  The goal of this project is to develop an Adobe Illustrator file that is a geographical map representational of the geographical location of the company's programs' reach within Sonoma County, CA as well as state and nationwide represents the given datasets.
- Using Python and Jupyter Lab as a jumping off point, the datasets were cleaned and divided by program and then used to create a prototype of the final map in Illustrator.
- Taking each address from the dataset, which are divided into five individual educational programs, they were then converted into latitude/longitude coordinates via Google Geolocator API, and displayed on a custom map overlay made in Mapbox Studio.
- This year's version of the geographical map focuses almost entirely on Sonoma County with a small map present to represent the entirety of California and which programs are present in what county.
- Builiding upon the build/development process from last year, the points that were generated within the Jupyter Notebook were then exported as a .eps file and imported into illustrator for the final product, thus maintaining a higher degree of graphical accuracy.
- The map itself was purchased from [Scalable Maps](https://scalablemaps.com/map/california-gmap-reg2m) for ease of use, however it was heavily modified for use in the final product.
